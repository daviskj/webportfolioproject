    <p class="text-left">From a young age I have always been fascinated with wanting to know how things 
        work and figuring out what really makes things tick. I've also always been drawn to all things tech.
        Having the chance to become a software engineer is combining two of my greatest interests. Other hobbies 
    include: </p>
      <!--unordered list-->
    <ul>
            <li>Woodworking</li>
            <li>Hockey</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
        </ul>
                

    <p class= "text-left"> Discovering <b>Thinkful</b> was a gift. With their Software Engineering flex program, I am 
        able to still work full time as a delivery driver and also gain the skills I need to have a successful 
        future.</p>

    <p class= "text-Left"> When I graduate, I look forward to starting a new, rewarding career as a 
        Front-End Developer and learning much more from future and more experienced team members. </p>
